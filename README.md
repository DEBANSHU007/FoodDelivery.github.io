## Introduction
In today's busy world, people are increasingly ordering food online. They can easily order meals from their phones or computers and have the food delivered right to their door. Online food delivery is popular because it saves time, offers a wide variety of restaurant choices, and provides features like order tracking and special deals. As the demand for convenient food delivery grows, companies are creating advanced online systems to manage orders, track deliveries, and keep customers happy. These systems use smart technology to make the food ordering process simple and efficient for both customers and restaurants.

## Market Analysis
The online food delivery market has seen tremendous growth in recent years. According to industry reports, the global food delivery market was valued at over $150 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.8% by 2026, reaching an estimated $235 billion. To capitalize on this growing market opportunity, food delivery platforms must focus on optimizing their underlying systems and processes. This portfolio focuses on improving the data structures and algorithmic approach used in a food delivery platform. The goal is to create a more efficient and streamlined ordering process, enhance the user experience, and enable more effective delivery logistics.

## Why Online Food Ordering as a topic?
I have chosen the online food delivery system as the domain for this portfolio because it is a widely used service that plays a significant role in people's daily lives, handling a huge amount of data. This domain presents complex challenges that require the application of advanced data structures and algorithms to optimize various functionalities, such as order management, delivery logistics, personalization, and real-time tracking. Addressing these challenges offers the opportunity to showcase how the strategic use of data structures and algorithms can enhance the overall efficiency and user experience of the food delivery platform, making it a relevant and engaging choice for this portfolio.
