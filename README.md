## Introduction
In today's busy world, people are increasingly ordering food online. They can easily order meals from their phones or computers and have the food delivered right to their door. Online food delivery is popular because it saves time, offers a wide variety of restaurant choices, and provides features like order tracking and special deals. As the demand for convenient food delivery grows, companies are creating advanced online systems to manage orders, track deliveries, and keep customers happy. These systems use smart technology to make the food ordering process simple and efficient for both customers and restaurants.

## Market Analysis
The online food delivery market has seen tremendous growth in recent years. According to industry reports, the global food delivery market was valued at over $150 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.8% by 2026, reaching an estimated $235 billion. To capitalize on this growing market opportunity, food delivery platforms must focus on optimizing their underlying systems and processes. This portfolio focuses on improving the data structures and algorithmic approach used in a food delivery platform. The goal is to create a more efficient and streamlined ordering process, enhance the user experience, and enable more effective delivery logistics.

## Why Online Food Ordering as a topic?
I have chosen the online food delivery system as the domain for this portfolio because it is a widely used service that plays a significant role in people's daily lives, handling a huge amount of data. This domain presents complex challenges that require the application of advanced data structures and algorithms to optimize various functionalities, such as order management, delivery logistics, personalization, and real-time tracking. Addressing these challenges offers the opportunity to showcase how the strategic use of data structures and algorithms can enhance the overall efficiency and user experience of the food delivery platform, making it a relevant and engaging choice for this portfolio.

## Objectives
This portfolio focuses on improving the food delivery platform by making it work better and more efficiently. The main goals are: 
* Make the ordering process smoother and easier to manage. This includes things like tracking orders and making sure they are fulfilled quickly. 
* Enhance the experience for the people using the platform. This could mean improving features that make it more convenient, personalized, and transparent (so customers can see where their order is). 
* Optimize the delivery process to get the food to customers faster and more reliably. This might involve finding the best routes, reducing delivery times, and improving coordination between the platform, restaurants, and delivery drivers. 
* Usage of advanced data structures and algorithms to power all these improvements. The goal is to take advantage of these algorithms to make the whole food delivery experience better for everyone involved.

## Business Cases

**1. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 User Profile management and registerations**

**Use Case**  
* This allow users to create and manage their profiles. Users can input their personal information, manage addresses, and set preferences such as favourite cuisines. The system ensures secure handling of sensitive information like passwords and payment details.

**Challenges**  
* As more people sign up, the system needs to handle all the new accounts without slowing down. Preventing duplicate accounts is important to avoid confusion. Letting users customize their preferences is great, but organizing all that data efficiently is a challenge. Keeping track of who is currently logged in is necessary for a smooth experience.

**Market Benefits**  
* If the challenges are overcome, the user profile system can provide many advantages. Users will have a better experience and feel more secure, which builds trust. The system can run more smoothly with faster performance and lower costs.

**Data structure and Algorithms used**
* For managing active user sessions, linked lists can be used to track session information dynamically.
* Bloom filter algorithm can be used to quickly check whether an email or username is already in use during registration without having to search through the entire database.
* Binary Search Trees to store and organize the user's favorite cuisines and dietary restrictions. BSTs provide efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of these preferences, allowing for quick lookup
